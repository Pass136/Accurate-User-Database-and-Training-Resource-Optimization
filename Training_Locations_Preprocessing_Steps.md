### Preprocessing

We performed data preprocessing in the following steps:

#### Training Locations

* Checked and imputed the missing values
* Removed duplicate rows
* Corrected the data types of the attrubutes
* Removed unwanted punctuations 
* Imputed the NaN values with 0
* Create new table to continue modeling
* Assigning weights to the location columns
* Standardized the role location column by using StandardScaler()
* Normalized every feature by using MinMaxScaler()
* Assigned weights to every attribute
* Merged the orginal total cost to the result for reference
* Displayed reeults in a table in descending order
* Displayed the top 10 users with highest socres in a table
* Merged the two tables with outer join using a common field user
* Removed all the missing values
* Removed the duplicate rows
* Genereted new dashboard
* Adjusted column names
* Displayed the results by score from large to small
* Displayed the records that rating >= 0 
* Display the results by score from large to small
