### Preprocessing
We started off with cleaning the the three datasets that we were provided. Performing operations such as removing duplicates, changing the datatypes and imputing the missing data. After that we created additional columns based on the calculations that we did from the preexisting ones and removed the ones that we thought were unnessacary. In the next few steps we performed some mathematical calculations to find the weights for disposal roles and sstandardized the error cost column using the standard scaler. We also normalized the every other feature using the MinMaxScaler() for better results.
